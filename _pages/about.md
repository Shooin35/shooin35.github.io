Welcome to my website. I am Shuyi Chen, you can also call me Shooin.

I majored in Advertising in my undergraduate, that was really a fun experience where I found my interest in Advertising and Marketing. We used multiple features like audio-visual art into advertising and deliver powerful thought to more consumers via marketing.

However, in my internship in PR company (Burson-Marstellar) and Cosemetics company(Estee Lauder) I found I need to learn more quantiative skills to get accurate insights from consumers for better marketing. That's the reason why I studied in Marketing Analytics in Simon Business School.

This website shows my working projects in [Business Analytics](https://shooin35.github.io/publications/), I used R/sql/TABLEAU/Python to solve different business problems and make strong analysis.
You can also check my projects in [MKT & AD cases] (https://shooin35.github.io/talks/)and [Design] (https://shooin35.github.io/teaching/) where I put some of my planning projects and desined posters.(However, most of them are in Chinese version since these are jobs in my undergraduate.)
